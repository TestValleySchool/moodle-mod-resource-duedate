# moodle-mod-resource-duedate
A clone of Moodle's mod_resource ('File'), but with an additional feature to set a deadline.

We developed this module for teachers to set Home Learning Tasks (HLTs) which are intended to be handed in on paper, and are not suitable for the Assignment module.

These often involve a file with the homework instructions being uploaded to a course, in addition to setting a due date. We had been using *Course Events*, but this required two steps from members of staff. With this module, a file can be uploaded and a due date set and attached to that one activity. These due dates appear in pupils' calendars.

# Requirements

This requires Moodle 2.8. It may work with earlier versions if you alter the requirements in `version.php`, but this, as with any other modifications, isn't supported by us! :)

# Licence

This code is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3, or, at your option, any later version of that licence.
